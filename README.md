# Panahon
Panahon is a weather application that utilizes geolocation and third-party API from _OpenWeatherMap.org_. My co-workers for this project are _Aki Escarraga_ and _Cyrl de Guzman_. This project is for the partial completion of the course Mobile Development in De La Salle University.

## Features
The android application allows the user to do the following:
* View Local Weather.
* View Temperature both in Fahrenheit and Celsius.
* View Humidity.
* View Forecasts for the following 5 days.
* Search a certain place for its weather.

## Running the files in Android Studio
1. Either download the files through ZIP or Clone this using cmd by typing:<br />`git clone git@github.com:Lemsicode/android-fakestagram.git`
2. Make sure the file `local.properties` is present and automatically made by Android Studio.
3. If `local.properties` is missing, rebuild the app inside Android Studio.
4. Press the Run Button inside the app.
